Description: RVIMP is a package created for better interpretability of independen variables in the setting of Random Forests. The procedure is based on permutation variable importance (VIMP). These VIMPs measure a variable's marginal influence only, that can make its interpretation difficult or even misleading. This package contains a statistical test to detect dependencies within the set of independen variables and furthermore a method to correct affected variables for such dependencies.
